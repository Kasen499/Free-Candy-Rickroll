How to use it:

Option 1:
Save the File: Save the file with an .html extension, such as free-candy.html. Ensure that you select "All Files" as the file type when saving in Notepad to avoid adding a .txt extension.

Open in a Browser: Locate the saved file on your computer and double-click on it to open it in your default web browser. Youâ€™ll see the animated banners and the pulsating button on your screen.


Option 2:
Copy the code: Select all the text from <!DOCTYPE html> to the closing </html> tag and copy it.

Paste into an embed: (I just used google sites, but others wil work)
